![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-blue)

## **Introduction**
This repository contains the Library Management System in SQL that I completed as part of my course. The project is a Library Management System built using SQL to demonstrate my understanding of the concepts of create a database and tables as well as query a database and create stored procedures for a database. In this README you will find information about the purpose of the project, the technologies used, the runtime version, and other important details that will help you understand and potentially reproduce the project.

## **Technologies**
The project primarily makes use of the following technologies:
- SQL

## **Launch**
To ensure reproducibility, the project was developed using the following versions of the technologies:
- SQL
- SQL Server 2022
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) version 20.1

## **Scope of Functionalities**
The project serves as a basic example of a database. It includes the following functionalities:
- SQL

## **Examples of Use**
It demonstrates how to create a database with SQL.

## **Prerequisites**
Filestream must be installed in your SQL Server instance.

## **Install from a script**
The install scripts create the sample database to have the database compatibility of your current version of SQL Server. Each script generates the version-specific information based on your current instance of SQL Server. This means you can use either the Library Management System install script on any version of SQL Server .

## **Project Status**
The project is complete and serves as a demonstration of skills acquired during the course. No further development is planned at this time.

## **Sources**
The project was developed based on the knowledge and materials provided in the course. All code and design were created independently as part of the course.
